Please note that we have uploaded a separate image folder containing the ground truth labels called **images_label** in the HA4 folder. 

The images in this folder are named following the format: "imageid_ground truth id_ground truth name". The imageid is the same as the name in the original **image** folder and is only used for HA purposes; it does not provide any information about the image.

Additionally, we have included a file called imagenet_class_index.json to help you understand the relationship between the ground truth id, ground truth name, and the order in which the classes appear in the predictions of the ImageNet pre-trained model.

Please contact wxieai@connect.ust.hk if any questions.
